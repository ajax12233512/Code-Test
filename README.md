# Code-Test

## This project will assess the grade that the user recives after taking the Ultamite Coding Quiz. It was created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 

The Ultamite Coding Test was inspired by my motivation to challenge myself as an aspiring developer and to create a simple application to assess the competence of other developers as well. 
    
    -Many developers struggle to know whether they are competent enough to begin work in a professional enviornment. It is a common occurence that is felt amongst all developers at all different levels. The reason that many developers feel this way may boil down to different reasons such as self-esteem, or lack of experience. 
    -This coding test was made to help fellow developers get a good idea of what they know and don't know about HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It contains some basic questions about the nuances of each programming language so that you can gage where you stand on your ablility to understand these 3 technologies.
